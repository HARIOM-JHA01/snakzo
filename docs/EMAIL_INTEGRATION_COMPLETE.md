```
Order Creation Flow:
├─ User completes checkout
├─ Order created in database
├─ Inventory reduced
├─ Cart cleared
├─ Invoice PDF generated
├─ Order confirmation email sent (with PDF)
└─ Response returned to user

Order Status Update Flow:
├─ Admin updates order status
├─ Status saved to database
├─ Check if status changed
├─ If SHIPPED → Send tracking email
├─ If DELIVERED → Send delivery confirmation
└─ Response returned to admin

User Registration Flow:
├─ User submits signup form
├─ Validation checks
├─ User created in database
├─ Welcome email sent
└─ Response returned to user

Password Reset Flow:
├─ User requests password reset
├─ User verified in database
├─ Reset token generated

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Async Email Sending

All emails are sent asynchronously using IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):

```typescript
(async () => {
  try {
    await sendEmail({ ... });
    console.log("Email sent successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Email error:", error);
    // Don't fail the main operation
  }
})();
```

**Benefits:**

- Non-blocking (doesn't delay API responses)
- Error isolation (email failures don't break main flow)
- Better user experience (faster response times)
- Proper logging for monitoring

### Error Handling Strategy

- All email operations wrapped in try-catch
- Errors logged to console for debugging
- Main operations never fail due to email errors
- Success messages logged for monitoring

### PDF Generation

- Uses `@react-pdf/renderer` for professional PDFs
- React components for maintainable templates
- Buffer-based for efficient memory usage
- Attached directly to email (no intermediate storage)
